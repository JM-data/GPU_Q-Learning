# GPU_Q-Learning
A look on parallelizing Reinforcement Learning code on GPU using Theano and Keras

This repository is greatly inspired by Google DeepMind by Mnih et Al : "Asynchronous methods for deep reinforcement learning".

The Jupyter Notebook *ELTDM_Code&Report.ipynb* contains a clear report on the project's problem and also all the code commented. If however you just want the code, you will find it in the *DQN_Theano.ipynb* and *DQN_Keras.ipynb* Jupyter Notebooks.
